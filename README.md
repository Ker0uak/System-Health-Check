# System-Health-Check
– Checks CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Services — everything.

 I wish I had this Linux script years ago…


Ever SSH into a server and think:
“What the hell is going on here?”



That’s why I made this:

✅ 1 Linux script to rule them all
– Checks CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Services — everything.

Just copy → paste → run. Instant system health check. No more digging through 10 commands.




✅ Here’s what it does:

 • Shows top processes eating your RAM

 • Lists open ports & network interfaces

 • Highlights disk space issues

 • Prints running services

 • And more…
